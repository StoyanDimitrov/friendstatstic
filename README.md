# Friendstatstic

Fantastic Friends Stats is a little Chromium Devtools extension that gathers basic interaction stats for your friends and foes.

## Is it fake?
No. It works fantastic.

## How it works?
It listens for the results of the requests the game client (the flash) make and collects, groups and displays the information in a readable way.

## So this is how you steal my password?
No. I've got my own (*very strong*) password and don't need yours. At all.
